# Learn OpenGL Tutorial

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/git.fsfe.org/reuse/api)](https://api.reuse.software/info/git.fsfe.org/reuse/api)

This repository contains code examples that follow the tutorial from <https://learnopengl.com/> by [Joey de Vries](https://twitter.com/JoeyDeVriez). The code here is not official, but was created by me (Daniel Aim√© Valcour). The branches of this repository shows the state of my code after completing each page of the tutorial.

# How To Use
Instead of using Visual Studio, the project is defined in a cross platform manner using CMake. If you wish to generate it yourself, you need to run the following bash commands:

    git clone https://github.com/Journeyman-dev/learn-opengl
    cd learn-opengl
    # replace the -G option with the generator you want from https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html
    cmake -S . -B ./build/ -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" 
    # You can find the project in the folder named "build"

If you want to build the project without opening it in an IDE, you can use this command:

    cmake --build ./build/ --config Debug

If you want to add new source files, add them to the `src` folder and add their file names to the `target_sources` command in the <src/CMakeLists.txt>. If you do this, you may need to delete the build folder and re-generate the project. If you want to add include files, just add them to the `src` folder and you are good to go.
If you want to simplify this process, I recommend that you use the "CMake Tools" in Visual Studio Code. It comes as a part of the "C/C++ Extension Pack" (<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack>), along with everything else you need.
